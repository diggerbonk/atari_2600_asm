BUILD-7 July 10, 2017

    1) Removed smart bomb feature
    2) Added a single channel audio loop player for background music
    3) Tweaked some more ramp-up features, still a WIP.
    4) Various optimizations to squeeze the above things in, also a WIP

BUILD-6 Apri 2, 2012

    1) Refactor radar so that only one item is rendered per line. This will 
       allow assigning colors for each item. 
    2) Removed hills at top of screen, which allows more room for falling 
       debris and opens up some other gameplay options. Also freed up som 
       ram and rom space. 
    3) Added smart bombs.
    4) Game "Levels" run at various speeds based on current score. 
    5) Tweaked some sounds. 
    6) Radioactive elements are given a different color on the radar.


BUILD-5 March 12, 2012

    1) Fixed an out of bounds index in create_missile
    2) Got rid of bounds checking in create_debris, no longer necssary 
       or desirable now that the game wraps.
    3) Moved the horizontal fine adjust table onto a page boundary so the
       end label position gets calculated correctly.
    4) Eliminated the animation counter
    5) Added debris move tables to get granular control over debris speed.   
    6) Objects can scroll partially off screen
    7) Added waves with gradually increasing difficulty
           * Each wave gets longer
           * Speed increases over time
           * The ratio of radioactive to absorbing debris increases over time

    1) Optimized the playfield scrolling a bit.
    2) Falling debris now disappears behind the hills instead 
       of on top of them.
